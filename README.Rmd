`randotools` contains functions for creating randomisation lists, and other related tasks, in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `randotools` from github with:

<!-- install.packages("randotools") -->

``` r
remotes::install_github("CTU-Bern/randotools")
```

<!-- Or from CTU Bern's package universe -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("randotools", repos = c('https://ctu-bern.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Check the imbalance expected for a proposed strata/blocksize combination

Before generating a randomisation list, it can be useful to know whether the that 
will be attained with a certain number of strata is going to be appropriate. 

```{r}
library(randotools)
set.seed(456)
check_plan(50, n_strata = 5, n_sim = 100)
```

In the above example, we a relatively high degree of imbalance for a relatively 
small sample size, so reducing the blocksize or number of strata would be recommended.


## Generating randomization lists

Generate the randomisation list itself with `randolist`.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
r <- randolist(50, arms = c("Trt1", "Trt2"), strata = list(sex = c("Female", "Male")))
```

Create a short summary of the randomisation list with `summary`.

```{r}
summary(r)
```

Export the randomisation list in a database compatible format with `randolist_to_db`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
randolist_to_db(r, target_db = "REDCap",
                strata_enc = list(sex = data.frame(sex = c("Female", "Male"),
                                                   code = 1:2)),
                rando_enc = data.frame(arm = c("Trt1", "Trt2"),
                                       rand_result = 1:2)
                )
```

## Assessing randomisation imbalance

Under some scenarios (e.g. minimization), it can be helpful to monitor the imbalance of the randomisation process. `randotools` includes some tools to assist with this, specifically in terms of comparing observed imbalance with what might be observed with simple random allocation.

`imbalance_seq_plots` shows the evolution of imbalance along the randomisation sequence:

```{r imbseq, fig.path="man/figures/", message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
data(rando_balance)
imbalance_seq_plots(rando_balance, "rando_res")
```

`imbalance_test` compares the observed imbalance with random allocation, providing a p-value, which can then be plotted to inspect the observed (the red line) and simulated imbalances (the bars):

```{r imbtest, fig.path="man/figures/", message=FALSE, fig.height=3}
(imb <- imbalance_test(rando_balance, "rando_res"))
imbalance_test_plot(imb)
```
